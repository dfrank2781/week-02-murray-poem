Once upon a time there was a girl named Eliza
She had a dilemma, and would let nothing despise her
She was very smart, and it was clear she was set apart
Just like a computer, she seemed so correct that no one could refute her
Just like the motions of life, her ways were so far advanced they gave a glimpse of the future
